# Mercury File Structure Refactoring Plan

## Context and Goals

This document defines a target file structure for the `Mercury/Mercury` module and a migration plan for current oversized files.

Primary goals:

1. Make directory ownership clear and stable.
2. Keep file counts per directory reasonable.
3. Split oversized files into smaller files with explicit responsibility boundaries.
4. Preserve behavior while refactoring (structure-first, logic-stable).

---

## Organizing Principle

Use **feature-first** structure as the primary axis, and **responsibility layer** as a secondary axis inside each feature.

Additional constraint:

1. Do not create directories deeper than **two levels under `Mercury/Mercury`**.
2. If a directory becomes crowded, prefer splitting files by prefix/responsibility before introducing a third nesting level.

Why this is preferred over pure `Model/View`:

1. Current complexity is dominated by feature domains (`Reader`, `Agent`, `Translation`, `Usage`) rather than UI vs data.
2. Pure `Model/View` would still create overloaded directories.
3. Feature-first keeps related runtime, storage, contracts, and views close to each other.

---

## Target Directory Layout

```text
Mercury/Mercury
  App/
    Views/
  Core/
    Database/
    Tasking/
    Shared/
    Views/
  Reader/
    Views/
    Theme/
  Agent/
    Runtime/
    Provider/
    Summary/
    Translation/
    Settings/
    Shared/
  Feed/
    UseCases/
    Sync/
    ImportExport/
    Views/
  Usage/
    Views/
  Resources/
  Views/   (temporary during migration; target is to remove or keep very thin wrappers)
```

Why this flatter layout:

1. Remove the extra `Features/` wrapper to keep paths short and scanning cost low.
2. Make the first path segment directly express ownership (`Reader`, `Agent`, `Feed`, `Usage`).
3. Keep room for one responsibility layer without crossing the two-level limit.

---

## Directory Contract and Placement Criteria

### `App/`

Purpose:

1. App entry point and root composition.
2. App-level dependency wiring.
3. Global environment and app lifecycle glue.

Put files here when:

1. The file configures application startup, scenes, or root state wiring.
2. The file has no feature business logic and mostly coordinates modules.

Keep out:

1. Feature-specific runtime logic.
2. SQL, migration, and queue internals.

Typical files:

1. `MercuryApp.swift`
2. Root `ContentView` composition shell (if kept app-level).

### `App/Views/`

Purpose:

1. App-shell views and window-level composition.
2. Views that coordinate multiple feature panes at once.

Put files here when:

1. The view composes feed, reader, status, or settings areas into the main app shell.
2. The primary job is application-level layout, not one feature's business UI.

Keep out:

## Naming and File Size Rules

### Directory depth

1. Maximum nesting: two levels under `Mercury/Mercury`.
2. Allowed examples: `Reader/Views`, `Agent/Translation`, `Core/Database`.
3. Disallowed examples: `Features/Reader/Views`, `Agent/Translation/Views`, `Feed/ImportExport/OPML`.

### Naming

1. Keep existing prefixes (`Agent*`, `Summary*`, `Translation*`, `Reader*`) to preserve discoverability.
2. For split files, use `BaseName+Responsibility.swift` pattern.
3. One file should read as one responsibility in one sentence.

### File size guardrails

1. Domain type/contract files: target `<= 200` lines.
2. Use-case/service files: target `<= 300-350` lines.
3. SwiftUI main view files: target `<= 350-450` lines.
4. Any file above `500` lines requires explicit split rationale.

### Directory size guardrails

1. Target `<= 12-18` files per directory.
2. If a directory exceeds `20` files, first split oversized files.
3. If a directory still exceeds `20` files, add at most one second-level subdirectory under the top-level domain.
4. Do not solve crowding by adding a third-level directory.

---

## Split Principles

These principles override any earlier tendency to split files too aggressively.

### Size thresholds

1. Files under `500` lines are acceptable by default.
2. Files in the `500-1000` range require judgment, not automatic splitting.
3. Files over `1000` lines should be split for manageability, even if the module is still coherent.

### Cohesion first

1. If a file still represents one architecturally independent module, do not split it just to make the line count look cleaner.
2. Internal ordering, `MARK` grouping, and code locality are preferred over fragmentation when the module boundary is still clear.

### When splitting is justified

1. Split when a file contains multiple parallel modules or clearly separate sub-flows.
2. For `>1000` line files, split by function into a small number of peer files.
3. Prefer `extension`-based split files for one large type/module instead of extracting many tiny helper files.

### When splitting is not justified

1. Do not split a file only to make all files numerically similar.
2. Do not create one file per helper or one file per tiny concern inside an otherwise coherent module.
3. Do not create more sub-directories to compensate for over-splitting.

### Cross-group dependency review rule

1. `App` and `Core` are foundational layers; other groups depending on them is normal.
2. Cross-dependencies among `Reader`, `Agent`, `Feed`, and `Usage` need explicit review.
3. If a type is used broadly across those feature groups, either the boundary is wrong or the shared part should move into a more neutral shared layer.

### `AppModel+TranslationStorage.swift` (659)

Status:

1. Keep as one file for now.
2. Revisit only if later changes create multiple parallel modules inside it.

Actual split:

1. `TaskQueue.swift` — `actor TaskQueue` scheduling core only (~315 lines).
2. `AppTaskContracts.swift` — all `AppTask*` value types, `TaskQueueEvent`, and execution context typealiases.
3. `TaskTimeoutPolicy.swift` — `NetworkTimeoutPolicy` struct and `TaskTimeoutPolicy` namespace.
4. `DebugIssue.swift` — `AppUserError`, `DebugIssueCategory`, `DebugIssue`.
5. `TaskCenter.swift` — `@MainActor final class TaskCenter` (queue observer / UI bridge).

2. `DatabaseManager+Migrations.swift`

### `FailurePolicy.swift`

Status:

1. Move in Phase 3.
2. It is consumed by `Core/Tasking` and `Feed`, so it should not remain under `Agent/Shared`.

Target location:

1. `Core/Tasking/FailurePolicy.swift`

### `ReaderSourceSegmentsSnapshot`

Status:

1. Rename in Phase 3.
2. The type is part of the translation input contract, even though Reader views also consume it.
3. Keep it in `Agent/Translation`, but remove the Reader-prefixed naming.

Target shape:

1. `TranslationSourceSegment`
2. `TranslationSourceSegmentsSnapshot`
3. Move the type definitions into `TranslationContracts.swift`

### Usage report contexts

Status:

1. Move in Phase 3.
2. `AgentSettingsView` may continue presenting Usage views, but the report context types should belong to `Usage`, not to `Agent/Settings`.

Target location:

1. `Usage/Views/UsageReportContexts.swift`

### `AgentLLMProvider.swift` (517)

Status:

1. Keep as one file for now.
2. It is large but still one provider implementation module.

8. `AppModel+TranslationStorage.swift`

Notes:

1. Translation input snapshot contracts live here, even if Reader views project or render them.
2. Reader consuming translation state is by design; that does not make the contract Reader-owned.

### `Agent/Shared`

### `Usage/Views`

Current files covered:

1. `UsageReportView.swift`
2. `UsageComparisonReportView.swift`
3. `ProviderUsageReportView.swift`
4. `ProviderUsageComparisonReportView.swift`

6. `ModelUsageComparisonReportView.swift`
7. `AgentUsageReportView.swift`
8. `AgentUsageComparisonReportView.swift`
9. `UsageReportContexts.swift`

Directory sanity result:

1. `Feed/Views` is required.
2. `App/Views` is required.
3. `Core/Views` is justified by shared UI helpers.
4. `Reader/Rendering` was not necessary and has been removed from the target structure.
5. `Usage/Domain` and `Usage/Query` were too fine-grained and have been collapsed into `Usage/`.

---

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Directory Re-homing (No behavior changes)

1. Move files to target domain/core directories.
2. Keep file names and APIs unchanged.
3. Keep final paths within the two-level directory limit.
4. Ensure project compiles after each move batch.

Exit criteria:

1. `./scripts/build` passes.
2. No functional behavior changes.

### Phase 2: Low-risk splits

Scope:

1. Split `Feed/UseCases/UseCases.swift` into one use-case type per file.
2. Do not split `ReaderTheme`, `TaskQueue`, `AgentLLMProvider`, or `AppModel+UsageReport` in this phase.
3. Prefer no-op on other `500-900` line files unless a second independent module is discovered.

### Phase 3: Medium-risk splits

Scope:

1. Move `FailurePolicy.swift` to `Core/Tasking/`.
2. Rename `ReaderSourceSegment` / `ReaderSourceSegmentsSnapshot` to translation-owned names and move their definitions into `TranslationContracts.swift`.
3. Move usage report context types out of `AgentSettingsView.swift` into `Usage/Views/UsageReportContexts.swift`.
4. Light split `Core/Database/DatabaseManager.swift` into manager surface and migrations.
5. Split `Agent/Shared/AgentExecutionShared.swift` using medium-granularity responsibility boundaries.
6. Split `Agent/Settings/AppModel+Agent.swift` into defaults, provider, and model files.
7. Keep `Usage/AppModel+UsageReport.swift` intact in this phase.

### Phase 4: High-risk splits

Scope:

1. Split `Agent/Translation/AppModel+TranslationExecution.swift`.
2. Split `Reader/Views/ReaderSummaryView.swift`.
3. Split `Reader/Views/ReaderTranslationView.swift`.
4. Keep `Reader/Views/ReaderDetailView.swift` intact unless Phase 3 review shows a stronger need.

### Phase 5: Cleanup and consistency

1. Remove obsolete wrappers.
2. Normalize naming and `MARK` structure.
3. Align tests and docs to new paths.

---

## Placement Decision Checklist (For New Files)

When adding a new file, apply this order:

1. Is it app entry point / wiring only? Put in `App/`.
2. Is it cross-feature infrastructure? Put in `Core/`.
3. Does it belong to one feature domain? Put in `Reader/`, `Agent/`, `Feed/`, or `Usage/`.
4. Inside a top-level domain, is it `Views`, `Runtime`, `Storage/Query`, or `Contracts`? Place by responsibility, not by type keyword.
5. If responsibility sentence contains two independent verbs, split before adding.

---

## Non-goals

1. No architecture rewrite during structural split.
2. No behavior changes mixed into move/split commits.
3. No broad renaming that obscures git history unless required.
